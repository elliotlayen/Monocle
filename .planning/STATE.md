## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 10 phases derived from 26 requirements at fine granularity; browsing foundation first, validation second, search third, analytics/comparison fourth, monitoring last
- [Roadmap]: Research recommends quick-xml, encoding_rs, react-arborist, recharts; all I/O patterns (async + timeout + streaming) established in Phase 1-2

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Network I/O patterns over VPN-accessed SMB shares need real-world validation in early phases
- tokio::fs::read_dir hang on UNC paths (tokio#5473) -- workaround needs testing on Windows
- react-arborist async lazy loading with Tauri IPC needs prototyping
